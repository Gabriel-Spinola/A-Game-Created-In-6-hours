# 12-Hours Game Run
 
I was bored, so I created a game with a language that I never used in 12 hours or less, in fact, I don't remember. 
At least it was cool

You will need pygame to run
``` pip3
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

if you have some issue with the instalation go to this [site](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)
